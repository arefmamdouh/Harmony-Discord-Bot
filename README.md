# Harmony-Discord-Bot
hello this is harmony, a bot I made to help make your life on your discord server better. 

## Adding the bot to your server
here is the link https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=906587857760698388&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.events.stdlib.com%2Fdiscord%2Fauth%2F&response_type=code&scope=guilds%20guilds.join%20bot

## Pulling this code
if you want to pull this project and use it, you will have to create a ".env" file and set the token to your own bot's token. 
You can search up "how to hide a discord bot's token", you would also need to use this command in the command line and in the project's directory "npm install". 

## Adding features
if you want to add a feature just add it in the commands folder and for example if the command is named help then you should name it accordingly: "help.js".

# Happy Coding!!!
