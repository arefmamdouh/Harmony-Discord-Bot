# Harmony-Discord-Bot
hello this is harmony, a bot I made to help make your life on your discord server better. 

## Pulling this code
if you want to pull this project and use it, you will have to create a ".env" file and set the token to your own bot's token. 
You can search up "how to hide a discord bot's token". 

## Adding features
if you want to add a feature just add it in the commands folder and for example if the command is named help then you should name it accordingly: "help.js".

# Happy Coding!!!
